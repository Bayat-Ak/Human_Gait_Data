# Human_Gait_Data
200GaitData
The goal of this study is to introduce a comprehensive gait database of 100 human subjects who walked between two endpoints during two different sessions (200 sessions) and their gait data were recorded using two smartphones, one that was attached to their right thigh and another one was carried by a phone holder on the left side of their waist. 

This data is collected with the intention to be utilized by a deep learning-based method which requires enough time points. The metadata including age, gender, smoking, daily exercise time, height, and weight of an individual is recorded.
