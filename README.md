##200GaitData: Gait Analysis and Recognition Based on Smartphone Inertial Sensors to Study Individual Differences in Over Ground Walking

Abstract: The goal of this study is to introduce a comprehensive gait database of 100 human subjects who walked between two endpoints during two different sessions (200 walking sessions) and their gait data were recorded using two smartphones, one that was attached to their right thigh and another one was carried by a phone holder on the left side of their waist. The metadata including age, gender, smoking, daily exercise time, height, and weight of each individual was also recorded.

Aim: This motivation to collect this data was to create a large human gait database collected in real-world conditions suitable to be used in deep learning algorithms.

This project was proposed and led by Dr. Akram Bayat under the supervision of Professor Marc Pomplun in her final year as a Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts Boston. This project was partially supported by a GSA grant that was given to Akram Bayat.
IRB approval: This Project has been reviewed and approved by the University of Massachusetts Boston IRB, Assurance # FWA00004634.
